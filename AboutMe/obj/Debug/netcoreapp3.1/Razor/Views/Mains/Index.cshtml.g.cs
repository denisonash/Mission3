    <p class=""footnote"">
        My husband recently picked up a new hobby: birding. Although
        it is not <i>my</i> top activity to do, I do love spending time
        with him and like it enough to do so. So that's something I've been
        spending more time doing recently.

    <h2>What do I hope to get out of this class:</h2>
    <p>
        Honestly, when the semester started, I had zero idea what this class was even about. Now I think I
        know slightly more, still a bit in the dark haha. But I'm really excited to learn this new way of
        developing web apps. One thing I want to get better on this semester while learning this new way is
        improving my css skills. They are decent, but I haven't focused on them as much as I would");
            WriteLiteral(@" have liked
        to in the past. So as I work on projects, I want to be more focused on that. I also want to learn git
        better because it's a struggle for my group. I know a bit about it, but not nearly enough. Since we are
        using it for our assignments, it seems like the perfect opportunity.
