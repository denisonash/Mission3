        <p class="footnote">
            My husband recently picked up a new hobby: birding. Although
            it is not <i>my</i> top activity to do, I do love spending time
            with him and like it enough to do so. So that's something I've been
            spending more time doing recently.

        <h2>What do I hope to get out of this class:</h2>
        <p>
            Honestly, when the semester started, I had zero idea what this class was even about. Now I think I
            know slightly more, still a bit in the dark haha. But I'm really excited to learn this new way of
            developing web apps. One thing I want to get better on this semester while learning this new way is
            improving my css skills. They are decent, but I haven't focused on them as much as I would have liked
            to in the past. So as I work on projects, I want to be more focused on that. I also want to learn git
            better because it's a struggle for my group. I know a bit about it, but not nearly enough. Since we are
            using it for our assignments, it seems like the perfect opportunity.
